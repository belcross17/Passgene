# Password Generator Starter Code
    In this app, we would be able to address a major issue with keeping company or user's information save, which the problem is Passwords.
    We are going to give 5 different prompts to the user to be able to chose which ones they would like applied to their new password.
    These 5 prompts are: Length, Lower case, Upper Case, and Numbers.
    This app will provide random passwords that include the user's specific preferences, this will help keep information secure.
